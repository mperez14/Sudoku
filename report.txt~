Lab Report

	The user uses the program by entering the element (number for standard sudoku or a letter for wordoku) to add and the position on the board (row and column number).The user then keeps adding elements until the puzzle is complete (filled).
	The program works internally by initializing a 9x9 board (default board is blank, non default board can be read from a file). The program then checks to see if the board is filled (ie no 0's), if not the program will prompt the user for an element, row number, and column number. The program then checks to see if this move is valid (ie there is no other similar number in the same row, col, or mini grid) if the move is valid, the piece is added to the board and the new board is displayed to the user. The program then loops until the board is complete.
	The program was verified using multiple different boards. I did the standard board that was on the lab document (which reads in a predefined sudoku board, that is partially filled). I also did a character board for wordoku that reads in a predefined sudoku board with letters. 
To check if my complete function works, I created a board that only needs one more element to complete. After entering the last element, the program congratulates the user and the program ends. The last baord I did was a blank board, where the user starts from scratch, filling elements.
	The program works as it's intended. Some concepts I might try and implement is figuring out how to make the constructor dynamic so that it instatiates the correct size board depending on the file being read. Currently my constructor defaults the size of the board to 9 everytime. Also another thing I might implement is a more user friendly interface when playing. How the game is set up now, if a player gets stuck and wants to change an element that he/she already placed, it is diffcult since he/she will have to take into consideration if there will be any errors with adding the new piece to that position since the check function is built into the add function. However if I separate the check function and the add function the player can make changes more easily and I can just display what errors there are.
